# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on using a credit card transaction dataset to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build a machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions. The dataset contains detailed information about transactions, card usage, and cardholder details. Originally in JSON format and saved as a text file, the dataset comprises 29 columns and 786,363 rows.

# Objective
The primary goal is to gain insights into transaction patterns, such as multiple card swipes, amount reversals, and trends related to transaction amounts. Ultimately, the project aims to build an accurate model capable of predicting whether a given transaction is fraudulent.

## Context
Fraud detection is a critical concern for banking and financial institutions, as well as for their customers. Quickly and accurately identifying fraudulent activity helps prevent financial loss and builds trust. In this project, the objective is to create a machine learning model that can effectively classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate, ensuring better security and risk management in financial systems.
